## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Essential Software Requirements
- **.NET 9.0 SDK**: Required to build and run the application. Download from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Recommended IDE for development. Download from the [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). 
  - During installation, ensure you select the "ASP.NET and web development" workload.
  - For .NET 9.0 development, make sure to include the necessary components during installation.
  - Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio Code with the C# extension.
- **SQL Server**: Required for the database backend. Options include:
  - SQL Server 2019 Express (free, recommended for development)
  - SQL Server Developer Edition
  - SQL Server Standard/Enterprise Edition
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: Recommended tool for managing SQL Server databases.
  - Alternative SQL clients: Azure Data Studio, DBeaver, or any SQL client of your choice.

### Additional Requirements
- **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository.
- **Entity Framework Core Tools**: For database migrations, can be installed via NuGet package manager in Visual Studio or via the command line:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
  ```
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading package dependencies and NuGet packages.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a command prompt or terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ST10343093/Prog_POE
cd Prog_POE
```

### 2. Database Configuration

Follow these steps to set up your database:

#### Step 2.1: Create the Database
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance
3. Right-click on "Databases" in the Object Explorer
4. Select "New Database..."
5. Enter `AgriEnergyConnectDB` as the database name
6. Click "OK" to create the database

#### Step 2.2: Update Connection String
1. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the project root directory
2. Locate the `ConnectionStrings` section
3. Update the `DefaultConnection` to match your SQL Server instance name:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YourServerName\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=AgriEnergyConnectDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```

Replace `YourServerName` with your actual SQL Server instance name. You can find your server name in SSMS when you connect to the database.

**Note for SQL Server Authentication**: If you're using SQL Server Authentication instead of Windows Authentication, your connection string should be:

```
"DefaultConnection": "Server=YourServerName\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=AgriEnergyConnectDB;User Id=YourUsername;Password=YourPassword;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
```

### 3. Apply Database Migrations

This step will create all necessary database tables and seed initial data:

#### Option A: Using Visual Studio Package Manager Console
1. Open the solution file (`Prog_POE.sln`) in Visual Studio
2. Open the Package Manager Console from the menu: Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console
3. Ensure the Default project (dropdown at top of console) is set to the main project
4. In the console, execute the following command:
   ```
   Update-Database
   ```
5. Wait for the command to complete - you should see "Done." message

#### Option B: Using Command Line Interface (CLI)
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
2. Make sure you have the EF Core tools installed (see Prerequisites)
3. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
4. Wait for the command to complete successfully

### 4. Install Required NuGet Packages

The project depends on several NuGet packages. If they aren't automatically restored, you'll need to install them manually:

#### Using Visual Studio:
1. Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer
2. Select "Restore NuGet Packages"
3. Wait for the process to complete
4. If any package errors occur, open the NuGet Package Manager (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution)
5. Install any missing packages, ensuring versions are compatible with .NET 9.0

#### Using Command Line:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 5. Configure IIS Express (Optional)

If you're using IIS Express in Visual Studio:

1. Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer
2. Select "Properties"
3. Go to the "Debug" tab
4. Ensure the profile is set to "IIS Express"
5. Verify the App URL is set correctly (typically https://localhost:44300/ or similar)

### 6. Build and Run the Application

#### Option A: Using Visual Studio
1. Open the solution file (`Prog_POE.sln`) in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B or selecting Build > Build Solution from the menu
3. If any build errors occur, resolve them before proceeding
4. Run the application by pressing F5 or clicking the green "Play" button
5. Wait for the application to compile and launch
