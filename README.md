- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (Express edition is sufficient for development)
- [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) (or any SQL client)

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agri-energy-connect.git
cd agri-energy-connect
```

### 2. Database Configuration

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio or your preferred SQL client
2. Create a new database named `AgriEnergyConnectDB`
3. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to match your SQL Server instance:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=AgriEnergyConnectDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```

### 3. Apply Database Migrations
